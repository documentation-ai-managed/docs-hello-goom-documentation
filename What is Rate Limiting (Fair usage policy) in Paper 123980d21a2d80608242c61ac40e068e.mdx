# What is Rate Limiting (Fair usage policy) in Paperguide?

At Paperguide, we strive to provide seamless research assistance through AI-powered tools like Chat with PDF, AI Writer and more. To ensure that all users can enjoy a smooth and reliable experience, we have implemented **rate limiting** for AI generations. 

This document explains how rate limiting works and how it might affect your use of the AI features.

## How Does the Rate Limit Work?

Paperguide allows you to make **50 AI requests every 3 hours** (Rate limit may vary depending on your subscription plan) across all AI research assistant toolswhich includes the prompts for literature review, data extraction requests, chat with papers/pdfs, AI summary and AI search features. Each time you ask a question, generate content, or use AI-powered features, it counts as one request.

Once you’ve reached 50 requests, you won’t be able to use AI tools again until the 3-hour limit resets, at which point your usage will refresh, and you can continue using the features.

**Note:** This restriction does not apply to AI Writer (in case you have access to unlimited AI writer feature as part of your subscription)

## **What Happens When You Reach the Limit?**

If you reach the rate limit within a 3-hour period:

- **Temporary Pause**: You won’t be able to ask more questions, generate content, or use any AI-powered tools until the limit resets.
- **Waiting Period**: The limit resets automatically after 3 hours, and you’ll be able to start using the AI tools again with a fresh quota.

This ensures fair use for everyone while maintaining system performance.

## When Can You Use the AI Again?

Your call limit **refills every 3 hours**. After 3 hours have passed, the limit resets, and you can use the AI tools again with a fresh quota of calls.
