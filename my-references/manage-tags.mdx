## Organize References Efficiently with Tags

Tags in Paperguide help you quickly group and filter papers, making your research library cleaner and more accessible. Use tags to create personalized categories—like "read soon," "machine learning," or "collaboration"—and streamline your referencing workflow.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Tags are flexible and work across all your references, not just within folders. Easily search or filter your library by any tag you've created.
</Callout>

## What are Tags?

Tags are custom labels you assign to your references in Paperguide. They make it easy to organize, group, and find papers based on any criteria you decide.

## Creating Tags

There are two main ways to create tags in Paperguide:

- **When adding or editing a reference:**\
  Use the **+ Tag** button in the reference details pane.

- **From the Tags sidebar:**\
  Click **Tags** in your workspace sidebar, then select **Add** to create a new tag for future use.

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  You can create as many tags as you need! Use descriptive, short names so they're easy to browse and search.

  </Step>

    Your changes save automatically, so you can close the pane when done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  If you remove all tags from a paper, it will no longer appear in any tag-based filters but will still be found in your library.

## More About Tags

Keep your referencing system tidy and powerful by following these tag best practices:

- Use tags in combination with folders for extra flexibility.

- Regularly review your tags to avoid duplicates or overly narrow categories.

- Use clear, memorable names (for example: **To Read**, **Reviewed**, **Topics: AI**).

- Filter your references by multiple tags to create dynamic reading lists.

- Removing a tag from the tag sidebar removes it from all references without deleting the papers themselves.
