### **Check Your Email**:

- If you’ve been invited to a shared folder, you will receive an email invitation from Paperguide.

- Even if you are not a Paperguide user and have been invited to a shared folder, you can still access the folder by registering for an account.

- To access the shared folder, you must log in or sign up using the **same email address** that **received the invitation**. This ensures you have the correct permissions to view or interact with the shared file.

### **Accept/Reject Invitation:**

- On clicking the **Accept/Open folder** button, you’ll be redirected to Paperguide to take action accordingly.

- Once you accept the invitation, you can access the folder under **the "Shared with me"** section.

- If you reject the invitation, you won’t be able to access it. And an admin must re-invite you to join if you want to join the folder.
