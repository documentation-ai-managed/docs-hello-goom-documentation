  Folders in Paperguide are private and fully customizable—only you can view or modify your reference folders unless you choose to export or share selected items.

## Managing Folders

Organize your references efficiently by managing folders as your research evolves.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Move references" icon="arrow-right">
    To move references from one folder to another, simply **drag and drop** the reference entry onto the destination folder or subfolder in the sidebar. The reference will be reassigned immediately.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Reorder folders" icon="list">
    You can reorder folders and subfolders by dragging them up or down in the sidebar to prioritize projects or research phases as you wish.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive folder and subfolder names for different projects or themes.

- Periodically review folders to archive completed projects or reorganize subfolders.

- Maintain a small number of top-level folders, using subfolders for finer structure.

- Use manual entry or import tools to keep your references up to date.
