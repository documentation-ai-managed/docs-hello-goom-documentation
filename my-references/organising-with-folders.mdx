Paperguide allows you to efficiently organise your references into flexible, user-created folders. The folder system is accessible via the sidebar in **My References**, giving you an easy way to structure your research library for quick access and ongoing project management.

<Callout kind="info">
Folders in Paperguide are private and fully customizable—only you can view or modify your reference folders unless you choose to export or share selected items.

Organise your references efficiently by managing folders as your research evolves.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Move references" icon="arrow-right">
To move references from one folder to another, simply **drag and drop** the reference entry onto the destination folder in the sidebar. The reference will be reassigned immediately.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Rename folder" icon="edit">
Rename a folder by right-clicking its name in the sidebar and selecting **Rename**. Enter the new desired name and confirm.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Delete folder" icon="x-circle">
To remove a folder, right-click on its name and select **Delete**. Confirm the action to permanently delete the folder and all references only present in that folder.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Reorder folders" icon="list">

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<ExpandableGroup>
<Expandable title="Can I create nested folders?" default-open="false">
Currently, Paperguide supports a single folder hierarchy level. Multiple folders are allowed but subfolders (nested folders) are not supported yet.
</Expandable>
<Expandable title="Do deleted references disappear everywhere?" default-open="false">
Deleting a reference from its last folder will remove it from your entire Paperguide library. If a reference exists in multiple folders, removing it from one folder does not delete it from others.
</Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Best Practices

- Use distinctive folder names for different projects or research phases.
- Periodically review folders to archive completed projects.
- Maintain a small number of top-level folders for easy navigation.
- Use manual entry or import tools to keep your references up to date.
