description: Learn how to efficiently organise your research materials in Paperguide's Reference Manager using folders. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating, managing, and navigating your reference folders.
---

## 1. Introduction to Folder Organisation

Keeping research materials ordered can be challenging, especially as your collection grows. Paperguide’s Reference Manager offers powerful folder organisation features to help you sort references by project, topic, or priority.

<Callout kind="info">

Folders allow you to group references in whatever way works best for your workflow—by course, paper, theme, or any system you choose.

</Callout>

## 2. Accessing the Folder Panel

To start creating and managing folders, first open your Reference Manager.

**How to access the folder panel:**

- Log in to Paperguide and navigate to **My References** from the main menu.
- The left sidebar displays your folder structure.

## 3. Creating a New Folder

<Steps>

<Step title="Click the 'New Folder' Button" icon="folder-plus">

  
Locate and click the **New Folder** button in the sidebar. This opens a create dialog.
  

</Step>

<Step title="Name Your Folder" icon="edit3">

  
Enter an appropriate folder name (e.g. *Literature Review*, *Thesis Sources*).
  

</Step>

<Step title="Save the Folder" icon="check-circle">

  
Click **Create** (or **Save**) to add the folder to your list.
  

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

Name folders clearly and consistently for easier retrieval later. Consider including course codes or project names in folder titles.

## 4. Adding References to a Folder

You can move existing references into folders or add new ones directly.

## 5. Managing and Renaming Folders

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Rename" icon="edit3">

  
- Right-click the folder you wish to rename.
- Select **Rename** from the menu.
- Enter the new name and click **Save**.
  

</Tab>

<Tab title="Delete" icon="x-circle">

  
- Right-click the folder to remove.
- Select **Delete**.
- Confirm the deletion in the prompt.
  

</Tab>

<Tab title="Reorder" icon="chevron-right">

Deleting a folder will **not** delete the references inside. They will remain in your library under "All References" unless you explicitly remove them.
