## Annotation Tools Overview

Paperguide integrates several annotation tools into the PDF reading workflow. Here’s how they work together to enhance your research:

### Write Notes & Annotate

There are multiple ways to access the notes and annotation view:

- You can either click on the paper itself and then click "**View PDF**" button in the Bib tab,

- Or you can click on the **three-dot** option on the paper card. Then, click on “**notes”** in the displayed list.

- Or click on Notes tab that appears beside AI Summary tab when you click a paper in Reference Manager section

### **Highlight Text in PDF Notes View**

- You can highlight the text on the PDF by clicking on the “**Highlight”** button on top. Then drag and highlight the text on the PDF.

- The highlighted text will be displayed in the right side notes section. You can even add comments or change the color of the highlighted text.

### **Draw/Snap in PDF Notes View**

You can even take a snapshot of an area on a PDF and add it to notes.

- Select the “**Draw**” button on top, and the cursor changes to the “+” icon. Then, drag and highlight the area on the PDF where you want to add a note or save as a note.

- After highlighting, a comment box appears. There you can add your notes or comments.

- All the notes and highlights will be saved to **Notes** on the right side.

### Edit Notes

To edit the notes already added or highlights made:

- Go to the Notes section on the right side in PDF view and click on the three-dot icon on the notes you wanted to edit.

- Then, select the edit option from the option list and edit the content.

## Why Annotate Papers in Context?

Keeping notes within the context of the source paper offers several benefits for academic work:

- You never lose track of which insight came from which article.

- Revisiting annotated papers later lets you quickly recall the main takeaways and your reflections.

- Sharing annotations promotes collaboration and transparency within research groups.

- Contextual organization speeds up writing, referencing, and literature reviews.
