<Expandable title="How does Paper/Reference Bib compare to tools like Zotero?" default-open="false">
  Paperguide focuses on workflows that integrate research, writing, and reference management without frequent app switching. While tools like Zotero are excellent for large libraries and standalone management, Paperguide’s Paper/Reference Bib is designed for deep integration with your writing and team collaboration and includes built-in support for importing from Zotero.
