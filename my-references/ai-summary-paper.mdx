## How It Works

The AI Summary feature can be used on any paper you upload or import into Paperguide. With one click, Paperguide processes the document and displays a succinct summary that highlights objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. 

<Steps>

<Step title="Upload or Import Your Paper" icon="upload">

  
Select a PDF or supported file from your computer, or import one from a reference manager (such as Zotero).

</Step>

<Step title="Generate AI Summary" icon="robot">

  
Click the "Summarize with AI" button next to your paper reference. The system analyzes the entire paper using natural language processing.

</Step>

<Step title="Review the Structured Summary" icon="list">

  
The summary will appear directly within your reference details. It highlights:
- Main objectives and research questions
- Methods and experimental design
- Key results and findings
- Primary conclusions

  
</Step>

### Example: AI-Generated Summary

<Request tabs="Cited Paper, Raw Extraction" show-lines="false" default-tab="1">

```markdown
**Cited Paper Summary**  
This paper investigates the role of synaptic plasticity in memory formation. Using a combination of computational models and biological experiments, the authors show that long-term potentiation at specific neuron types is critical for encoding spatial memory. The main findings highlight the dynamic interaction between neural circuits and the implications for treating memory disorders.
```

```markdown
**Raw Extraction**  
The study explores synaptic changes associated with spatial memory. Methods include in vivo recording and neural simulations. Results show enhanced potentiation in hippocampal circuits following training sessions. The authors conclude that targeted interventions may support cognitive therapies.

## Important Verification Note

<Callout kind="alert">

While Paperguide's AI summaries are designed for accuracy, always **verify critical details by reading the original paper directly**. AI-produced content may occasionally omit nuances or misinterpret specific data.

<Expandable title="What types of papers are best suited for AI summarization?" default-open="false">

  
Most peer-reviewed journals, conference papers, and preprints in PDF format are supported. Papers with clear structure (abstract, sections, references) yield the best summaries.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What information is included or excluded in the AI summary?" default-open="false">

  
Summaries emphasize objectives, methods, principal findings, and main conclusions. Supplementary data, figures, or precise statistical values may not be referenced explicitly.
