1. **Access the Literature Review Tab**:
    - From the Paperguide homepage, go to the **Literature Review** tab.
2. **Enter Your Research Question**:
    - Type a detailed question or topic in the search bar (e.g., “What are the recent advancements in AI healthcare applications?”). Specific questions yield more precise results.
3. **Analysing Papers:**
    - Paperguide searches through Paperguide's extensive research database of 200 million+ academic papers.
4. **Review the Results**:
    - Paperguide will retrieve the **8 most relevant papers** (or 5 for non-subscribers), generate a summary of insights, and create a **Literature Review Table** for easy comparison of papers, covering details like findings, methodologies, and conclusions.

This workbook is automatically saved and accessible in the **My Workbooks** menu for future reference.
