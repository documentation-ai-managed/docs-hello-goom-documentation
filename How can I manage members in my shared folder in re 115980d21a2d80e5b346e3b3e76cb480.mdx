1. **View Shared Folder Members**:
    - Click on **three-dot icon** next to the folder name.
    - Then, click on **Manage Members** button from the dropdown list.
2. **Edit Member Roles**:
Next to each member's name, you can adjust their role. Change the appropriate permission for each member based on your needs:
    - **Can View**: Allows the member to **only view** the folder and its papers along with notes.
    - **Can Add Notes**: Grants viewing access and the ability to **add notes** to the papers.
    - **Can Edit**: Full access to **view, edit, add notes, and modify** papers in the folder.
3. **Remove a Member**:
    - If you no longer want a member to have access to the folder, you can click **Remove** (delete icon) on the right side of their name. They will no longer be able to access the shared folder.
