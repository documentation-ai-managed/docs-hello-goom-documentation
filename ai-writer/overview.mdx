## Start Writing Your First Document

1. **Draft Your Sections**

   Begin by outlining the sections you want to include in your document. The initial prompt that you give can help determine what headings/subheadings the AI assistant will create as outlines. For example, if you are writing a research paper, common sections in the outline might include an introduction, literature review, methodology, results, and conclusion.

2. **Use AI Writing Assistant**

   If you’re unsure how to start, use the **AI Writing Assistant** to generate ideas or first drafts for specific sections. You can ask the AI to summarize research, propose arguments, or even expand on a topic. Simply type in your request, and the AI will generate content to help you get started.

3. **Insert References**

   While writing, you can easily insert citations from your **Reference Manager**. Highlight where you want to add a citation, click the **Cite Paper** button, and select the relevant reference from your library. If you don’t have a relevant paper added in your references, search the public research database based on relevant search terms.

4. **Format Your Document**

   Use the formatting toolbar to style your text. Add headings for each section (e.g., Heading 1 for main sections and Heading 2 for subsections). You can also create lists, block quotes, or insert tables if needed.

### **Save and Export**

- Once you’ve finished drafting and editing, you can save your document within Paperguide.

- If needed, export the document to a Word file, PDF, or other format for submission or further editing.

### Tips:

- Take advantage of the **AI Writing Assistant** to help with writer’s block or when you need help generating ideas or drafting sections.

- Organize your references ahead of time in the **Reference Manager** to make citation insertion faster while writing.

- Use the **Outline View** to keep track of your document’s structure and navigate between sections easily.
