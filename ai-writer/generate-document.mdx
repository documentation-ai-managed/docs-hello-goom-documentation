Staring at a blank page, unsure where to begin? ☹️ Writing an academic paper from scratch can feel overwhelming—but it doesn’t have to be. Our newest **AI Writer** feature eliminates the frustration by generating complete academic papers from just a topic.

## How to Generate a Full Paper in Simple Steps

1. **Create & Select:** Open a document, click the **"Generate Full Paper"** button, and choose your paper type: research paper, literature review, case study, essay, or article.

2. **Describe the topic:** Write about your writing topic or research question.

   *Try: Impact of Social Media on Adolescent Mental Health*

3. **Enter Requirements:** Specify the subtopics to focus on, sections to include, intended audience, and any writing preferences in the Requirement section.

   *Try: "Cover depression and anxiety correlations, sleep pattern disruptions, and intervention strategies; include a methodology section for empirical studies; avoid clinical terminology; target educational psychologists and school counselors."*

4. **Connect Knowledge Sources:** Select saved references from your library and optionally include papers from the public research database. The system will reference and cite these throughout your document.

5. **Review Outline:** AI creates a structured outline based on your inputs. Edit sections, rearrange content, or add elements as needed, then confirm.

   The system expands the outline into a complete document with proper structure, in-text citations, and a reference list. You can review it and make any changes as necessary using the Ask AI and cite features.

**Once confirmed, AI creates your complete paper with proper citations. ✨**
