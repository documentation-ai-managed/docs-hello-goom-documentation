Here's a step-by-step guide to using this feature:

- **Open 'Ask AI'**:

  - Go to the new line where you want to generate content using AI.

  - At the bottom of the writing area, you will find the ✨ **Ask AI** button; click on it or press **Ctrl+J** to open the AI suggestions dropdown menu.

- **Choose a Writing Option**:

  From the dropdown menu, you will see several AI-powered writing options:

  - **Custom Prompt:** In the input field displayed after opening Ask AI, you can enter your own custom prompt to generate your writing exactly how you need it. Or you can choose any of the template options below:

  - **Continue Writing**: The AI will help you continue from where you left off.

  - **Write an Introduction**: Generates a well-structured introduction based on your content.

  - **Write a Conclusion**: Helps you craft a concluding paragraph that summarizes your arguments.

  - **Write an Opposing Argument**: If you need to present a counterargument, this option helps you frame it.

  - **Write with More Depth**: Expands on your existing content by providing more details or depth to a section.

- **Edit and Refine**:

  - After selecting the appropriate suggestion, the AI will generate content. You can review and refine the text to better fit your writing style or adjust the argumentation.

- **Continue Working**:

  - Once you have used the suggestion, you can continue writing or use **Ask AI** again to assist with other sections of your document.

### **Tips for Using Ask AI Suggestions**

- **Tailor Suggestions to Your Needs**: Use the option that fits the stage of your writing. For example, use **Write with More Depth** when you need to elaborate on a point.

- **Mix and Match**: You can combine different AI suggestions, like writing an introduction and then asking AI to **continue writing.**

- **Refine AI Output**: AI suggestions are a starting point. Always review and edit the content to ensure it aligns with your ideas and tone.

- **Custom Prompt:** In the input field you can enter your own custom prompt to edit or modify your writing exactly how you need.

- **Improve Writing**: Refines your writing by enhancing readability, flow, and style.

- **Humanize (AI Bypass)**: Adjusts the text to make it sound more natural and less AI-generated.

- **Simplify**: Reduces complexity in the text, making it easier to read and understand.

- **Translate**: Allows you to translate the selected text into various languages for multilingual support.
