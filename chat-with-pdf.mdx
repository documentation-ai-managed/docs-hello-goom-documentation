## What is Chat with PDF?

Chat with PDF is an interactive AI tool that understands the content of academic papers and can answer your specific questions about them. It works with:

- Any PDF you upload

- Papers from your reference manager

- Multiple papers simultaneously for comparative analysis

## How to Chat with References?

The **Chat with Paper** feature allows you to chat directly with the papers stored in your **Reference Manager** without the need to upload them. This is ideal for referencing previously saved papers.

1. Simply open your Paperguide References and select the **paper(s)** that you want to have/ask questions about.

   *You can select a max of 100 papers at a time for one chat session.*

2. Then, click on **the Chat with Paper** button on the top bar to initiate chat.

3. In the chat view, ask any questions or clarify doubts about the paper/document’s content, summary, methodology, or other details based on the document.

## How does it work?

1. From the Paperguide Home page, select the **Chat with PDF/Paper** tab.

2. Click on the **Upload area** or **Select** button to add your PDF file and upload the file.

3. Once uploaded, click on the **Proceed** button, and you’ll be navigated to the chat interface.

4. Enter your question into the chat input box that you’d like to ask. (or) select from the suggested questions.

## How to Ask Effective Questions:

**For better results, ask specific questions** to get more targeted answers (e.g., "What are the limitations of this study?" or "What are the business metrics highlighted in this article?").

- "What was the sample size and demographic breakdown?"

- "Explain the limitations of this study."

- "Compare the methodologies used in both papers."

- "What evidence supports the main conclusion?"

- "Summarize the results in simple terms."

  For complex papers, start with "What are the most important concepts I need to understand before diving into this paper?"
