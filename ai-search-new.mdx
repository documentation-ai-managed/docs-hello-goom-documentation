Research search usually breaks down in two places: finding the *right* papers, and turning those papers into a clear, evidence-based answer without spending hours filtering and skimming.

**Paperguide AI Search 2.0** is our new search experience built for that exact workflow. It’s powered by an **agent-driven process** that helps you go from **question → evidence → answer** in one flow.

## What is AI Search 2.0?

AI Search 2.0 is Paperguide’s upgraded research search experience, powered by an **agent workflow**. It’s built for **academic, scientific, medical and more research fields**.

You can type a:

- topic

- question

- paper title

- or plain-language description of what you want to find out

…just like a web search. But instead of returning a long list and leaving you to do the heavy lifting, AI Search 2.0 gives you:

1. **Top 20 research papers** most relevant to your query

2. A **synthesized answer** based on those Top 20 papers

3. A **reference list** so you can verify and continue reading

Think of it as: *search + selection + synthesis*, in one workflow.

## When should I use AI Search 2.0?

Use AI Search 2.0 when you want:

- a strong starting set of papers without manual filtering

- a quick research-grounded overview of a topic

- a reference-backed answer you can verify and expand

Common use cases:

- literature review starting point

- clinical or medical evidence overview

- exploring a new topic area

- finding papers similar to a known study

## How to use AI Search 2.0

You can start with whatever form your idea is currently in:

AI Search 2.0 is flexible. You can use it in a few common ways.

### Ask a direct research question

This is the most effective format.

Examples:

- “Does intermittent fasting improve insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes?”

- “What are the risk factors for postpartum depression in first-time mothers?”

- “How effective are SSRIs versus CBT for adolescent anxiety?”

**Tip:** If your question has a specific population or condition, mention it.

### Provide a topic

If you’re in the early phase of reading, a topic works well.

Examples:

- “Long COVID cognitive symptoms”

- “Microplastics and human health”

- “CRISPR off-target effects”

**Tip:** If it’s broad, add one extra constraint like *age group*, *setting*, or *outcome* to improve precision.

### Paste a paper title to find similar work

Great when you have one anchor paper and want the best related studies.

Examples:

- paste the title of a paper you trust

- or “papers similar to \[title] focusing on clinical outcomes”

### Describe what you’re trying to figure out (plain language)

This is helpful for non-experts or interdisciplinary work.

Examples:

- “I’m trying to understand if vitamin D supplementation reduces respiratory infections in adults.”

- “I want studies that compare remote vs in-person therapy outcomes.”

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  If your query is broad, add one detail that matters (population, condition, outcome, timeframe). You’ll get a tighter Top 20 list.
</Callout>

## How AI Search 2.0 it works

AI Search 2.0 is powered by an agent workflow that behaves less like “one search query” and more like a careful research assistant.

### Understanding your intent and planning

It starts by **understanding the intent** behind your prompt—what you’re actually trying to learn, not just the words you typed. From there, it creates a **search plan** and runs multiple targeted searches to widen coverage and reduce blind spots.

### Combining, re-ranking and selecting papers

Next, it **brings results together**, removes duplicates, and narrows down the set to the most relevant candidates. Then it **reranks** those candidates to prioritize papers that are more directly aligned with your question—favoring higher-signal research and recency where it matters—before selecting the **Top 20**.

### Answering with evidence

Finally, it reads the Top 20 as a set and produces a **synthesized answer** that reflects what the evidence says overall, while keeping the references attached so you can verify and go deeper.

In short: it doesn’t just return results—it does the research-style work of getting you to a focused set of papers and a grounded summary.

## Best practices for better results

### Write queries like a researcher (but keep them simple)

Good:

- “What is the evidence on X for Y population?”

- “Does A reduce B in patients with C?”

Also good:

- “Topic + constraint” (e.g., “Vitamin D supplementation respiratory infections adults”)

### Add one constraint if you’re broad

If you only type a general topic, add one extra detail:

- population, outcome, timeframe, or setting

### Use paper titles to expand your reading set

If you already have a key paper, paste its title to find strong related work quickly.

## FAQs

### What kinds of queries work best?

Research questions and “topic + constraint” queries work best.\
Examples:

- “Does X improve Y in population Z?”

- “Effect of A on B in patients with C”

- “Topic + (population/outcome/timeframe)”

### What does “Top 20” mean?

AI Search 2.0 selects a focused set of **20 papers** that are most relevant and useful for your query—so you can start reading without sorting through hundreds of results.

### Can I use AI Search 2.0 like Google?

You can search in a similar way—type naturally, paste a topic, question, or title—but AI Search 2.0 is **not web search**.

Paperguide searches only within our research corpus (**\~220 million research studies/papers**), not web pages, blogs, or general internet content. The results are a curated Top 20 paper list plus an evidence-grounded answer with references.

### Why don’t I see more than 20 papers?

AI Search 2.0 is designed to give you a manageable, high-signal reading set. If you need broader coverage, run a second search with a slightly different scope or refine your query.

### How does the answer get generated?

The answer is synthesized from the **Top 20 selected papers**, and references are included so you can verify and explore the sources.

### Can I ask follow-up questions?

Yes. After you get results, you can ask **follow-up questions in the chat** to go deeper, clarify findings, compare studies, or narrow the scope—without starting from scratch.

Examples:

- “Focus only on studies after 2020.”

- “What do systematic reviews say specifically?”

- “Any evidence in adolescents?”

- “Summarize key limitations across the Top 20.”

### What if the results don’t match what I expected?

Try one of these:

- add a population/condition/outcome constraint

- add a timeframe (e.g., “post-2020”)

- rephrase using a more specific research term

- paste a known paper title as an anchor and search from there

### Is AI Search 2.0 only for medical research?

No. It’s built for academic research broadly (science, engineering, social science, and medical research).

### Can I cite the synthesized answer directly?

You should cite the **source papers** listed in the references. The synthesis helps you understand and navigate the literature; the papers are the authoritative sources.
