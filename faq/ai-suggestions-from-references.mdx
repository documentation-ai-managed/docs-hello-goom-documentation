Here’s how you can receive suggestions from the papers in your **references** while writing:

1. **Ensure Your References Are Uploaded**:

   - Before you begin, make sure that all relevant research papers are uploaded to your reference manager. Paperguide will use these papers to generate contextually relevant suggestions.

2. **Provide a Clear Title or Prompt**:

   - When you create or edit a document, ensure the title or prompt is clear and specific. The AI uses this information to understand the context of your writing and suggest content based on the papers in your reference library.

3. **Use AI Commands for Suggestions**:

   - While writing, use the **Ask AI** feature by clicking it on the options bar at the bottom or pressing **Ctrl+J** to access the AI commands.

4. **Receive Contextual Suggestions**:

   - As you select any of the AI writing commands, Paperguide will automatically pull relevant content, data, or arguments from the papers stored in your **Reference Manager**.
