# How can I import a collection containing more than 50 files into Zotero?

When importing collections from Zotero into Paperguide, there are specific limitations and corresponding solutions to ensure smooth data transfer. 

Here’s what you need to know:

1. **Multiple Collections**: Users can import multiple collections from Zotero.
2. **File Limit per Collection**: Each collection can include only up to 50 files (attachments). However, it can include an unlimited number of references.

**💡Solutions to Overcome File Limitations:**

- **Divide and Conquer**: To manage more than 50 files, create a new collection in Zotero and move files from your existing collection to the new one. This way, each collection remains within the file limit.
- **Batch Importing**: You can import multiple collections at the same time, provided each collection contains fewer than 50 files. This allows you to efficiently manage and import a large number of files and references by organizing them into smaller, manageable collections.

We are committed to continually improving our platform. In the future, we plan to increase the file limit for collections, making your research process faster and your work more efficient and easier. Stay tuned for updates as we work to make these improvements a reality.
