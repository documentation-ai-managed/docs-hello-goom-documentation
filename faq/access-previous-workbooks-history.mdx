All your **Literature Review** and **Extract Data** workbooks are automatically saved in Paperguide, ensuring that you never lose your research progress.

You can easily access these saved workbooks from the **My Workbooks** menu, which serves as a complete record of your previous literature review searches and data extraction activities.

This feature allows you to revisit, organize, and continue your research efforts without starting from scratch, providing a seamless and organized history of your research activities for ongoing reference.
