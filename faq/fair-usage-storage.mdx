At Paperguide, we strive to provide seamless research assistance through AI-powered tools. To ensure that all users enjoy a smooth and reliable experience, we've introduced a **Fair Usage Policy for Storage.** 

This policy is designed to maintain the integrity of our platform and ensure that it's used primarily for research and academic purposes, **not just as general cloud storage**. 

Here’s how it works:

### Understanding the Fair Usage Policy

- **Initial Storage Limit:** As a Advanced user, you are initially allocated 100GB of storage.
- **Beyond 100GB:** If you reach this limit and are fairly using the storage for intended research, writing or academic purposes (not just for using our platform as cloud storage), you're eligible for additional storage.
- **Requesting More Storage:** Simply email us at [hello@paperguide.ai](mailto:hello@paperguide.ai)  and we will promptly add an additional 100GB to your account.

### **Why a Fair Usage Policy?**

This policy is in place to prevent the misuse of our platform as a general cloud storage service. It helps us maintain optimal performance and resource availability for all our users, ensuring that Paperguide remains a dedicated research tool.

### **Need More Information?**

If you have any questions about this policy or your storage needs, don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:hello@paperguide.ai). We're here to help you manage your research efficiently and effectively.
