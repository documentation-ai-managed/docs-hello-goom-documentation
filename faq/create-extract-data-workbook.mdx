**Follow these steps to create an Extract Data workbook:**

1. From the Paperguide homepage, go to the **Extract Data** tab.
2. In the **Extract Data** interface, choose the papers or documents you wish to analyze from your **Reference Manager**. 
    
    This feature works best when selecting multiple papers for side-by-side comparison.
    
3. Click on **Proceed**

Paperguide will create a table from the selected documents. You can add custom columns to review, summarize, or explore specific aspects for deeper analysis.

Your Extract Data workbook will be automatically saved and accessible in the **My Workbooks** menu for future reference.
