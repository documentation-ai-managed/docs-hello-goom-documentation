The **AI Knowledge Source** in Paperguide Writer refers to the choice of information repositories—whether public research databases, your references (reference manager), or both—that the AI uses to generate and inform the content during the writing process.

When writing document with Paperguide's Writer feature, selecting the right AI Knowledge Source can significantly enhance your writing process.

**Here’s how you can set the AI Knowledge Source when creating a new document.**

1. **Start a New Document**:

   - Click on the “Create New Document” button to start a new writer.

2. **Access the Create New Document Popup**:

   - A popup window will appear when you choose to create a new document. Here, you will find various options to customize your document creation.

3. **Selecting AI Knowledge Source**:

   - In the popup window, look for the option “AI Knowledge Source.”

   - You will see three choices:

     - **Public Research Database**: Select this option if you want the AI to use publicly available research databases and research papers to generate content. This is suitable for broad research and gaining insights from a wide range of academic fields.

     - **My References**: Choose this if you want the AI to utilize the papers or references stored in your Reference Manager. This option tailors the AI’s responses to the specific materials you have collected, making it highly relevant for your ongoing projects.

     - **Both**: This option allows the AI to harness both publicly available resources and your personal collection from the Reference Manager. It provides a comprehensive base of information, ensuring a thorough exploration of topics from both general and specific perspectives.
