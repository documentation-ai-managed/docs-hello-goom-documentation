title: How can I manage members in my shared folder in Reference Manager?
---
1. **View Shared Folder Members**:

   - Click on the **three-dot icon** next to the folder name.

   - Then, click on **the Manage Members** button from the dropdown list.

2. **Edit Member Roles**:
   Next to each member's name, you can adjust their role. Change the appropriate permission for each member based on your needs:

   - **Can View**: Allows the member to **only view** the folder and its papers along with notes.

   - **Can Add Notes**: Grants viewing access and the ability to **add notes** to the papers.

   - **Can Edit**: Full access to **view, edit, add notes, and modify** papers in the folder.

3. **Remove a Member**:

   - If you no longer want a member to have access to the folder, you can click **Remove** (delete icon) on the right side of their name. They will no longer be able to access the shared folder.
