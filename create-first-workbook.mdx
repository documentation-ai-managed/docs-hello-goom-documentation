title: Create First Data Extraction Workbook
---
Paperguide's **workbooks** are a powerful tool to streamline your literature reviews, extract key data, compare documents, and uncover new insights in your research. They save you time by helping you discover, analyze, and refine your findings.

In Paperguide, you can create workbooks in two ways:

1. **Literature Review**: If you already know what your specific research topic or question will be and you're ready to start finding literature to review, find/analyze research papers, and write a literature review, the Literature Review is the place to start.

2. **Data Extraction**: If you already have papers/documents in your reference manager and you'd like to extract data for comparison or use as part of a systematic or literature review, Data Extraction is the place to start.
