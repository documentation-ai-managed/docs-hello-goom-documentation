## Chat with PDF 2.0 overview

Chat with PDF 2.0 is the upgraded version of classic Chat with PDF/Papers, tuned for long, dense research papers and multi-paper workflows. It is designed for researchers and power users who already use Chat with PDF and want more reliable, evidence-backed answers.

You still chat with your PDFs and reference papers the same way, but the assistant now reads and reasons over full-text context instead of relying only on small chunks. This improves answer quality, follow-up behavior, and complex synthesis across multiple documents.

## What is new in 2.0

Chat with PDF 2.0 changes how the assistant reads your papers so it can stay grounded in the actual text, even for long or technical documents.

**Full-text context instead of only small chunks**

- The assistant uses a richer view of the full paper, which helps it keep track of arguments, notation, and definitions across sections.

- Follow-up questions like "where does it say that?" or "expand on this section" become more precise and consistent.

**Deeper research workflows on a single PDF**

You can now rely on Chat with PDF 2.0 for:

- Structured summaries of long sections or the full paper

- Extracting key claims with supporting evidence from the text

- Comparing arguments or results across sections or related papers

When you ask for quotes or evidence, the assistant responds based on the exact passages it found in your PDFs, reducing hallucinations and vague answers.

## What you can do with Chat with PDF 2.0

Use Chat with PDF 2.0 to speed up the slow parts of reading and synthesising research.

**Get quick, structured summaries**

- Turn a long paper into a short, structured overview (research question, methods, main results, limitations).

- Ask for section-specific summaries: "Summarise the methods section in bullet points for a lab meeting."

**Pull key claims with evidence and quotes**

- Ask: "What are the main claims in this paper, and where are they supported?"

- Get answers that highlight claims plus the exact sentences or paragraphs that support them.

**Compare papers and arguments**

- Compare methods, results, or assumptions across multiple papers in one chat.

- Ask questions like "How do these papers differ in their experimental setup?" or "Which paper reports stronger evidence for X?"

**Find gaps, open questions, and limitations**

- Ask the assistant to list limitations raised in the discussion sections across several papers.

- Use prompts like "What open questions do these papers leave unresolved?" to identify gaps for future work.

## Start a chat

## Tips for better results

Chat with PDF 2.0 is designed to handle up to 100 papers in one chat, but more context is not always better for reasoning-heavy tasks.

**Keep synthesis sets focused**

- For deep comparison or synthesis workflows, results are usually better when you include **up to around 10 papers** in a single chat.

- Use smaller, focused sets when you want nuanced comparisons, detailed limitations, or careful methodological differences.

**Ask specific, grounded questions**

- Prefer concrete prompts like "What are the main findings in section 4, and how do they relate to figure 2?" over "Explain this paper."

- When you need evidence, explicitly ask for quotes and page or section references.

**Use follow-ups for precision**

- After a broad summary, narrow down with follow-ups:

  - "Show me only the limitations that relate to sample size."

  - "Where exactly in the results section does the paper make this claim?"

- The assistant will use the same full-text context, so each follow-up becomes more precise.
