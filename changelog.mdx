  ## **Generate Document with Custom Outlines**

  You can now provide your own outline in the instructions field, and the AI will follow your structure while generating content.

  In “Generate Full Document,” add your outline to the instructions field along with other requirements.

  ## **Deep Research with Your References**

  If you already have papers saved on a topic, you can now generate Deep Research Reports using only those papers.

  In the Deep Research Report, select "Reference Manager" as the knowledge source and choose your folder. The agent will screen and synthesize findings from your saved papers instead of the public database.

  Useful when you've already collected papers and want a comprehensive analysis without searching again
