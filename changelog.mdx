  ## Introducing Literature Review Agent

  We’ve added a new **Literature Review Agent** to help you turn a research question into a traceable, structured review—without juggling dozens of tabs.

  **How it works**

  - Start from **our full database (\~200M papers)** *or* use **your reference manager** as the input set.

  - The agent creates a **step-by-step plan**, then helps you **find relevant papers**, **screen them**, and **extract key details** before drafting the review.

  **What you get**

  - A **structured literature review** with **citations** so you can verify claims quickly

  - The **candidate/selected papers list**

  - **Screening outcomes** (what was included/excluded and why)

  - **Extracted data** (so you can reuse it for tables, analysis, or writing)

  Use it for quick overviews or deeper dives—especially when you want the workflow and evidence in one place.

  ## Chat with PDF 2.0

  We have upgraded **Chat with PDF** to handle long, dense papers more reliably by using full-text context instead of relying only on small chunks.

  You can now run deeper research workflows on a single PDF, including:

  - **Structured summaries** of long sections or the full paper

  - **Extracting key claims with evidence** from the text

  - **Comparing arguments or results** across sections or related papers

  Follow-up questions also behave more predictably, especially for queries like "where does it say that?" or "expand on this section" — the assistant will quote and expand based on the exact passages it found.

  ## AI Search 2.0

  We have launched **AI Search 2.0**, a new search experience powered by an agent-driven workflow that helps you go from question → evidence → answer.

  Instead of a long list of results, AI Search 2.0 returns:

  - **Top 20 research papers** most relevant to your query

  - A **synthesized answer** built from those papers

  - A **reference list** so you can quickly inspect the underlying evidence

  It supports flexible queries as a topic, research question, paper title, or plain-language description. After you get your initial results, you can ask **follow-up questions in chat** to refine or go deeper without starting over.

  ## **Generate Document with Custom Outlines**

  You can now provide your own outline in the instructions field, and the AI will follow your structure while generating content.

  In “Generate Full Document,” add your outline to the instructions field along with other requirements.

  ## **Deep Research with Your References**

  If you already have papers saved on a topic, you can now generate Deep Research Reports using only those papers.

  In the Deep Research Report, select "Reference Manager" as the knowledge source and choose your folder. The agent will screen and synthesize findings from your saved papers instead of the public database.

  Useful when you've already collected papers and want a comprehensive analysis without searching again

  ## Deep Research with 50 Papers

  Remember how Deep Research Report used to screen 50 papers and build your report from the top 10? That worked well for quick overviews, but many of you told us you needed to dig deeper for comprehensive reviews and grant proposals. So we've expanded the options:

  - **Standard Report** Screen up to 80 relevant papers → Generate report from top 30 papers \
    *Great for thorough literature reviews and academic writing*

  - **Comprehensive Report** Screen up to 100 relevant papers → Generate report from top 50 papers \
    *Ideal for systematic reviews, meta-analyses*
</Update>

  ## Improved Search

  We've upgraded the semantic search engine that powers AI Search and Literature Review. This means better understanding of your research questions and more relevant results.

  #### **What's improved**

  - **Understands your questions better:** AI grasps the context behind your research questions, not just keywords.

  - **More relevant paper matching** Search results now include papers that are conceptually related to your query, not just keyword matches.

  - **Recognizes field-specific language** The system knows when different terms mean the same thing in your research area.

  For example, searching "machine learning in healthcare" now also finds papers about "artificial intelligence in medicine" or "automated diagnosis systems."
