## **Ask your research question or search by your research topic**

Instead of a generic keyword search, ask your question. Our AI works best with clear, focused questions like

- Does regular physical exercise reduce the risk of chronic diseases?

- Does gut microbiome diversity impact immune system function?

- What are the pros and cons of immunotherapy in treating autoimmune diseases?

*Tip: Use filters (by year, journal ranking, etc.) to refine results instantly.*

## **Get Detailed Answers with Direct Citations**

Paperguide will search through the 200 million+ research database and generate an answer backed by the top 10 research papers to your question, including exact quotes with citations. Papers are chosen based on **citation counts**, **journal rankings**, **semantic relevance**, and **keyword matching** for **high-quality** sources.

## Access the top sources/papers with instant insights

Along with the answer, you'll receive a list of the **top relevant papers** (usually 10 papers but less than 10 if filters are used) used to generate the response, shown in the **References** section.

Every relevant paper is ranked, with key quality indicators to highlight valuable research.

- **Citation metrics** help you find highly cited papers with significant impact.

- Easily spot top-tier journals using **SJR Journal Ranking**.

- Identify study types instantly with **Study Type/Method**.

- Save time with **Key Insights**, summarizing each paper’s findings.

These features help you evaluate research **faster and more effectively**.

## **Apply Filters to refine your search further**

AI Search has filters for *Year Range, Citation count, Open Access Status, PDF availability status, Field of Study, and SJR - Journal Rating Quartiles.*

## Switch to Table View (Literature Review view) for further, deeper analysis

When you click on “Analyze in table view,” it switches to the Literature Review view, and you can continue your research further by deep diving into each reference, extracting up to 50 parameters to compare and contrast, and also searching for more papers (using the Load more button). See the [literature review](/literature-review) for more details.

The AI Search feature simplifies the process of finding the most relevant research papers, allowing you to focus on understanding and analyzing the information with ease.

Try searching **your current research question** to see how quickly you get results.
