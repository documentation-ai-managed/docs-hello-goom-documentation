## Overview of the dashboard

The dashboard is your main entry point into the Paperguide research workspace, giving you quick access to search, agents, and your personal research tools.

You can:

- Ask questions or explore topics across 200M+ research papers

- Run agent-powered workflows like literature reviews and deep research reports

- Jump into your references, writing projects, data extraction tables, chats, and notebooks

## Unified input box: Search and Agent

The large input box at the top of the dashboard is where you start most tasks. Enter a research question, topic, or upload a file, then choose how Paperguide should work with it.

### Search

Use Search when you want to find papers and get research-backed answers from the public research database or your own references.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Type your question or topic" icon="edit-3" title-type="p">
    - Click inside the input box on the dashboard.

    - Enter a question (for example, "How does retrieval-augmented generation improve factual accuracy?") or a topic (for example, "graph neural networks for drug discovery").
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick your sources and filters" icon="filter" title-type="p">
    - Select whether to search across all 200M+ papers or only in your reference manager.

    - Add filters such as year, domain, SJR, or field of study to narrow the results.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the search and review results" icon="play-circle" title-type="p">
    - Choose the Search mode in the unified input.

    - Run your query to see relevant papers and a research-backed answer based on those sources.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Agent

Use Agent when you want Paperguide to run a multi-step workflow for you, such as a literature review, deep research report, or chatting with a PDF.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an agent workflow" icon="list" title-type="p">
    - In the unified input area, switch to Agent mode.

    - Select one of the quick options such as Literature Review, Deep Research Report, or Chat with PDF.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide your input or file" icon="upload" title-type="p">
    - For Literature Review or Deep Research Report, enter your research question or topic.

    - For Chat with PDF, upload or select the paper you want to work with.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the agent and review the output" icon="play-circle" title-type="p">
    - Confirm your selections and start the agent workflow.

    - Review the generated literature review, deep research report, or chat responses, and save useful outputs to My Notebooks or My Chats.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sources and filters

The Sources selector and filters help you control where Paperguide looks for evidence and which papers it surfaces.

- **Sources selector**

  - **All 200M+ research papers**: search across the full public research database.

  - **My reference manager**: search only within papers you have stored in your Reference Manager.

- **Filters**

  - Narrow results by **year** to focus on recent or historical work.

  - Restrict by **domain** or **field of study** to stay within your discipline.

  - Filter by **SJR** or other quality indicators to prioritize higher-impact venues.

  - Combine multiple filters to get a focused set of papers.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Use **Sources** together with **filters** to stay precise: for example, search only your reference manager, limited to the last 5 years, in your specific field of study.
</Callout>

## Kickstart examples

Kickstart examples appear below the unified input box to help you get started quickly.

- Show ready-made prompts for common tasks like exploring a new topic or comparing methods.

- Work as one-click starting points: select an example, tweak the wording if needed, then run it in Search or Agent mode.

- Give you ideas for how to phrase questions so you get clearer, evidence-based answers.

## Left sidebar navigation

The left sidebar is your persistent navigation across Paperguide. Use it to move between research, writing, data extraction, and past work without losing context.

Items in the left sidebar:

### Reference Manager

Reference Manager stores the papers you rely on, whether you import them from tools like Zotero or add them directly in Paperguide. From here you can manage collections and get AI summaries of individual papers to understand them faster.

### AI Writer

AI Writer helps you write documents with AI assistance and proper citations. It can cite from the full set of 200M+ papers as well as from your Reference Manager, so your writing stays connected to the underlying research.

### Extract Data

Extract Data lets you define structured extraction tables and fields, then pull key information from papers in your Reference Manager into those tables. This is useful for tasks like recording sample sizes, methods, or outcomes across many studies.

### My Notebooks

My Notebooks stores your notebooks, data extraction tables, and documents from AI Writer in one place. Notebooks generated by agents can be saved from chats and are marked with an "agent" tag so you can distinguish them from manually created ones.

### My Chats

My Chats keeps the history of your agent chats and searches together, including conversations from AI Search, Chat with PDF, Literature Review, and Deep Research Report. Use it to revisit previous questions, review answers, and continue earlier discussions.

### History (Old)

History (Old) provides access to your older searches, literature reviews, and chat-with-PDF sessions from the previous version of the workspace. Use it when you need to recover or reference work created before the current dashboard experience.
