## **AI Search 2.0 (New)**

Paperguide **AI Search 2.0** is an agent-driven workflow that takes you from **question → evidence → answer** in a single flow. It searches within Paperguide&apos;s large research corpus and guides you from your query to the most relevant studies, then to a synthesized, research-backed answer.

You can search using:

- A research topic or area.
- A specific research question.
- A paper title.
- A plain-language description of what you are investigating.

AI Search 2.0 returns three key outputs in one place:

- **Top 20 research papers** most relevant to your query.
- A **synthesized answer** based on those top 20 papers.
- A **reference list** so you can verify claims and continue reading.

**Quick start with AI Search 2.0**

1. Enter your query (topic, question, paper title, or description).
2. Review the **synthesized answer** together with the **Top 20 papers** and references.
3. Go deeper by opening references or asking follow-up questions in the chat.

To learn more about the agent-driven workflow and advanced options, see the dedicated [AI Search 2.0 guide](/ai-search-new).

## **Ask your research question or search by your research topic**

Instead of a generic keyword search, ask your question. Our AI works best with clear, focused questions like

- Does regular physical exercise reduce the risk of chronic diseases?

- Does gut microbiome diversity impact immune system function?

- What are the pros and cons of immunotherapy in treating autoimmune diseases?

*Tip: Use filters (by year, journal ranking, etc.) to refine results instantly.*

## **Get Detailed Answers with Direct Citations**

Paperguide will search through the 200 million+ research database and generate an answer backed by the top research papers to your question, including exact quotes with citations.

- With **AI Search 2.0**, the answer is synthesized from the **Top 20 most relevant papers** for your query.
- With the classic AI Search view, you will typically see around **10 top papers** (and sometimes fewer if filters are applied).

In both cases, papers are chosen based on **citation counts**, **journal rankings**, **semantic relevance**, and **keyword matching** for **high-quality** sources.

## Access the top sources/papers with instant insights

Along with the answer, you&apos;ll receive a list of the **top relevant papers** (in classic AI Search this is usually 10 papers, and in AI Search 2.0 you can see the Top 20 papers powering the answer). If filters are used, the number of shown papers may be lower.

Every relevant paper is ranked, with key quality indicators to highlight valuable research.

- **Citation metrics** help you find highly cited papers with significant impact.

- Easily spot top-tier journals using **SJR Journal Ranking**.

- Identify study types instantly with **Study Type/Method**.

- Save time with **Key Insights**, summarizing each paper&apos;s findings.

These features help you evaluate research **faster and more effectively**.

## **Apply Filters to refine your search further**

AI Search has filters for *Year Range, Citation count, Open Access Status, PDF availability status, Field of Study, and SJR - Journal Rating Quartiles.*
