## How AI credits work

Paperguide agents and AI features consume credits whenever they run tasks such as literature reviews, deep research reports, or data extraction. Each request uses a certain number of credits based on how much AI processing is required.

Credits are tied to your Paperguide plan and refresh every month.

## Monthly credits by plan

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Each Paperguide plan includes a monthly allocation of AI credits:

  - **Free users**: 1000 credits per month

  - **Plus users**: 10,000 credits per month

  - **Pro users**: 40,000 credits per month

  Your available credits determine how many AI-powered actions you can run across Paperguide in a given month.
