title: How to use Extract Data
---
Manually extracting and comparing data from research papers is tedious and error-prone.

Paperguide’s **Extract Data** feature helps streamline the research process by allowing you to extract and organize key information from academic papers or other documents you work on.

It provides enhanced flexibility with custom columns for deeper analysis. Here’s how you can get the most out of the **Extract Data** feature:

## **Create Your Extract Data Workbook**

1. From your dashboard, click on **Extract Data**

2. In the Extract Data interface, choose the papers you want to analyze from your **Reference Manager**. This feature works best when selecting multiple papers/documents to compare them side by side.

Upon clicking **Proceed**, Paperguide will create a table from the selected papers, which you can then use to review, summarize, or dig deeper into your topic by adding custom columns.

  In your **Literature Review Table**, locate the column customization icon on the top right of the table. This menu allows you to view existing columns and create new custom columns.

### Add Predefined Columns:

Under the **Default Columns** section, you’ll find predefined columns such as **Key Findings**, **Methodology, Limitations, Conclusions**, and more. These columns help you compare common aspects of the papers in your literature review.

Click the **Tab** icon (top right) to open **Manage Columns**. Choose from 20+ predefined options (e.g., study outcome, demographics, methodology). Our AI extracts the exact data—no manual work needed!

### **Create Custom Columns:**

If you need to track additional information, you can create custom columns by clicking on the **+ Create Column** button.

1. **Enter a title** (e.g., “Age”).

2. **Add instructions** for better results (e.g., "Identify and categorize participants as child, adult, or elderly based on age groups in the study").

Our AI extracts and fills the table automatically, making literature reviews effortless.

**Note**: If the paper does not contain information relevant to the custom column title, the system will indicate that no information is available.

### Save or Edit a Custom Column:

- After creating a custom column, it won’t be listed in the **Manage Columns** menu until you save it.

- You can hover over a custom column heading in the table to access options such as **Edit**, **Save**, and **Close**.

- Once a custom column is saved, it will appear under the **Saved Columns** section, allowing you to reuse it in other tables like the default columns.

## Export Your Workbook Table

- All your workbooks are auto-saved in your Paperguide.

- Once your table is complete and customized, you can export the table/papers in various formats such as CSV, Excel, and BibTex.
